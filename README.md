# distemper-outbreak
This repo contains models for optimizing animal placement in kennels in shelters at risk of a distemper outbreak.

The model uses a non-deterministic automata to update the local status for each kennel in a simulated shelter. Intervention objects can then operate on the kennel structure at any time point in the simulation to try out organizational strategies based on visible knowledge about the simulation state. The architecture of the simulation can be seen here:
